# A-Frame experiments

[![A Mesh!]({{site.baseurl}}/images/day2-mesh.png)](http://js13k.no-sync.com/rev/a3cf4dd)

Another day, and finally something to show for it! I have been investigating
[A-Frame](https://aframe.io), which as I've mentioned will be the main driver
behind the game (you know how it goes, about the gift horse and the teeth). The
A-Frame dependency does not count towards the game size, so I knew this would be
an important part of development.

Truth be told, my initial reactions have been mixed. Don't take me wrong!
A-Frame is an impressive piece of software. It follows a component model where
one can define what's in a scene with HTML-like tags. This makes creating simple
things a breeze, and if that was not enough, it comes with a built-in inspector
to debug the scene elements and modify them in real time. You can also define
new components and then use them in the scene, similarly to Angular or
React. Finally, since elements are part of the DOM, they can be modified by
using DOM-manipulation libraries, or just plain old `createElement()`,
`querySelector()`, etc.

The reason for the mixed feelings is, this library seems to have been designed
with ease of use as the primary goal. I think they have clearly succeeded in
this front, and I can totally see how someone that is not too well versed in
JavaScript could get started with VR. However, this may not be the best for a
competition where code size is a huge factor. Take this code as an example:

```html
<a-scene>
  <a-sphere color="#FF00FF" radius="0.2" position="0 0 -10"></a-sphere>
  <a-sky color="#CCCCCC"></a-sky>
</a-scene>
```

This is really easy to follow, but now think what happens when you have hundreds
or thousands of primitives. First, in a game with such size restrictions a lot
of the content will be generated procedurally. Second, this cannot be compressed
easily. So it is clear to me that the declarative approach is out of the
question. That leads us to the next logical step: the elements need to be
generated using JavaScript. However, that is still going to be suboptimal
because there's a lot of boilerplate to create them. In the previous example, if
we tried to add the pink sphere, we'd do something like this:

```js
let scene = document.querySelector('a-scene');
let sphere = document.createElement('a-sphere');
sphere.setAttribute('color', '#ff00ff');
sphere.setAttribute('position', '0 0 -10');
sphere.setAttribute('radius', '0.2');
scene.appendChild(sphere);
```

Even though the JS minifier does a pretty good job, there are things that can't
be compressed, like strings. For now I am using this approach, but I am keeping
an eye on the minified output to find out potential issues.

For fun, I did a couple tests with different approaches to test the compression
rate. The goal was to generate approximately a thousand spheres. The first
implementation used a thousand `<a-sphere>` elements, the second used a
JavaScript loop with a logic similar to the previous example (although with
variable positions), and the third used the same loop with a helper function to
try to reduce the size of the DOM function calls (which can't be compressed):

```js
function sa(el,k,v) { el.setAttribute(k,v); }
```

The code sizes were as follows:

| Case    | Size (bytes) |
|---------|-------------:|
|Baseline |1140          |
|HTML     |1505          |
|JS loop  |1291          |
|JS helper|1298          |

Even though it's a naive test, I think it clearly shows that the declarative
HTML approach is out of the question. It also demonstrates that, at least for
small cases, having a helper to reduce the minified code size is not too
helpful. However, I am sure this would change if the `setAttribute()` function
was called a lot more.

Finally, there's the problem of procedural generation. My initial goal is to
create a landscape (yeah, I think I have a game idea, more on that below!), and
that would use some kind of heightmap generation. I have not been able to find
an example in A-Frame where one can access a mesh vertices individually, so for
this it seems to me the only way to go is to use the underlying
[three.js](https://threejs.org/) library.

This took me by surprise, to be honest. I was not planning to learn two 3D
libraries for a game competition (hey, at least it's a month long!). However,
A-Frame is just a layer on top of three.js, and more complex things need to be
done at a lower level. On the bright side, three.js is bundled with A-Frame, so
it's also for free! So with some help from a couple tutorials on
[how to create an A-Frame component](https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/introduction/writing-a-component.html#creating-the-box-mesh)
and and example of
[terrain generation with three.js](http://blog.mastermaps.com/2013/10/terrain-building-with-threejs.html),
I was equipped to code the mesh you can see at the beginning of the post.

# Game idea

On the front of game ideas, I was thinking about the *"lost"* theme and I came up
with a concept that seemed worth more exploration. The idea is this: A bunch of
hikers get lost and disbanded in the mountains, and you (the player) are part
of an aerial rescue team. The area is rough, so instead of descending to the
field, you must use signals to guide the hikers to a safe exit. I was thinking
the player can throw flares, which the hikers will follow to an exit
location. Obviously, things get complicated because these hikers are not too
bright and will happily throw themselves to a certain death (Joey, who thought
getting drunk in the forest was a good idea??), and as the game progresses there
will be new dangers to make the rescue mission even more complicated (night,
fires, Lovecraftian horrors).

I was super proud of the idea until I later realized it had some mechanics in
common with [Darwinia](https://www.introversion.co.uk/darwinia/) (which
coincidentally also came from a game jam!). However, I think I can find enough
interesting variations to make it a decent game.

# Next steps

Tomorrow I'll start with terrain generation, and who knows, perhaps
