Today was my first day on the competition, and my main accomplishment was
deciding to participate. I've wanted to write a game from start to finish for
some time, and the format of most competitions is not good for me because they
require spending a couple days away from work and family. The J13KGames
competition spans a whole month, so I should have enough time to do something in
my spare time.

I've always wanted to write a VR game as well, so this year's WebVR track is
perfect for that! I haven't yet thought of what I'll do, but I already have some
ideas that should match the **LOST** theme. This is what I have in mind so far:

 - *I'd like to do something atmospheric*. In my opinion, one of the great
   advantages of VR when telling a story is the ability to completely surround
   the player. Every ray of light that is captured by the eye can be controlled
   by the game, so I'd like to create something that creates a very immersive
   experience.

 - *I'd like some procedurally generated content*. I am not an expert in this,
   but 1) I may need some kind of generated content to avoid hitting the 13KB
   limit and 2) I've always wanted to try it!

 - *In principle, I'm going for very basic artwork*. The two main problems with
   art is I am not an artist, and the assets are part of the space limit. I may
   be able to convince some friends to help with this, but I'm not counting on
   it. On the other hand, procedural content may be a way of not having to spend
   my time fighting Blender.

And that's what I know so far! I wanted to spend this first day doing some
research on the technologies I'll use (I know [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) will
be one of them, and I've also read interesting things about
[TinyMusic](https://github.com/kevincennis/TinyMusic)), but in the end I spent
all the time configuring Github Pages and Jekyll. This has been a pain, but one
of my goals is keeping the journal, so I guess it's been a good investment.

The goal for tomorrow is generating a basic skeleton and a development
pipeline. I am looking forward to you, Webpack! (not). Hopefully I can also
think of some more concrete game idea.
